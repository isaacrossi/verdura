# Verdura
Verdura is a landing page for a veggie burger restaurant with an ever-changing menu. I decided to create this website to really cement some of the
things I had learnt so far on CSS, HTML & JS. It was also good to design something from scratch myself to help me progress in that area too.

## Things I learnt:

- How to use **CSS grid** properly, and how good it is for responsive design.
- I read a few things about how to write **clean code** and tried my best to implement some of those things (eg. BEM naming, meaningful whitespace).
- How to set up with **Contentful** to get JSON data from their CMS's API so the restaurant menu can be updated by the client.
- How to set up and use **Sass** on a project.
- How to use **gulp** to manage multiple tasks in one place.
